| 5: Scroll Reveal & Hero Animations | Scroll reveals, hero entrance, accessibility fallbacks | 4/4 | PASSED |
| 6: Image Overlay Sections | Hero gradient + reusable overlay pattern | 2/2 | PASSED |

## Cross-Phase Integration

All 11 requirement integration paths verified. Key cross-phase wiring:

| Connection | Status | Detail |
|------------|--------|--------|
| Phase 5 → Phase 4 `--transition-easing` | WIRED | Scroll reveal and fadeUp both consume var(--transition-easing) |
| Phase 6 → Phase 4 H2 accent bars | WIRED | .overlay-section h2::before overrides to white |
| Phase 6 + Phase 5 scroll reveal | WIRED | Produtos CTA overlay section works with .reveal pattern; z-index layering correct |
| All pages consistent | WIRED | All 5 HTML pages load css/style.css and js/animations.js |
| Reduced-motion covers all phases | WIRED | CSS @media + JS matchMedia disable Phase 5 animations; Phase 6 has no animated properties |
| No-JS fallback complete | WIRED | .js-enabled gate makes all content visible without JS; Phase 4/6 pure CSS |

**Integration issues:** None

## E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Status | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| Page load (index.html) | PASS | Hero gradient visible, text fades up with stagger, scroll reveals trigger below fold |
| Page load (other pages) | PASS | CSS typography/spacing applied, scroll reveals trigger where present |
| Scroll interaction | PASS | IntersectionObserver at threshold 0.15, -40px rootMargin; elements reveal once |
| Reduced-motion user | PASS | All animations suppressed, content appears instantly |
| No-JS user | PASS | All content visible, gradient overlays still work (CSS only) |
| Produtos overlay section | PASS | Background image + gradient overlay + scroll reveal + white H2 accent bar |

**Broken flows:** None

## Tech Debt

Minor documentation gaps (non-blocking):

1. **Phase 4 SUMMARY frontmatter** — 04-01-SUMMARY.md and 04-02-SUMMARY.md lack YAML frontmatter with `requirements-completed` field. Requirements are fully verified in 04-VERIFICATION.md with detailed evidence.

2. **Variable naming in descriptions** — Milestone description references `--transition-speed` but the actual CSS custom property is `--transition-duration`. No functional impact; all consumers correctly reference the real variable names.

**Total:** 2 documentation items across 1 phase. No code-level tech debt.
