# Phase 4: Typography & Spacing Foundation - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-18
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Refine typography, spacing, cards, and interaction timing across all pages so they feel premium. Fluid type scaling, generous whitespace, polished card shadows/radii, H2 accent bars, and unified hover transitions. Scroll animations and image overlays are separate phases (5 and 6).

## Implementation Decisions

### Claude's Discretion
User deferred all visual decisions to Claude. The following areas are open for researcher and planner to determine best approach:

- **Fluid typography** — clamp ranges, scale ratio, font weight choices
- **Section spacing** — gap sizes, vertical rhythm, breathing room between sections
- **Card polish** — shadow depth/layers, border radius, internal padding
- **H2 accent bars** — color (brand palette), width, thickness, position relative to heading
- **Hover & transition timing** — duration, easing curve, which elements get hover effects
- **Consistency** — ensuring all interactive elements share the same transition speed and easing

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements — open to standard approaches. Follow the existing brand palette and modern design conventions.
