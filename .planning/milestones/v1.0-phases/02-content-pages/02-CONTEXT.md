# Phase 2: Content Pages - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-18
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Fill all 5 pages (Home, Empresa, Produtos, Localização, Contato) with complete MetaMedical content. Visitors can learn about the company, browse products, find the location, and see contact details. No new structural changes — the site shell from Phase 1 is fixed.

## Implementation Decisions

### Home page hero
- Full-bleed background image style with tagline overlay
- Use the existing hero image from metamedical.com.br
- "Compromisso com a saúde" tagline displayed over the image

### Home page product preview
- Mini product cards showing each product name + image
- Cards link to the Produtos page
- Gives visitors a quick visual taste of the product line

### Product card detail
- Brief format — product name + 1-2 sentence description per card
- Keep it concise, not spec-heavy
- Product images sourced from the current metamedical.com.br site

### Claude's Discretion
- Value pillars layout on home page (icon+text cards, blocks, etc.)
- Product card layout on Produtos page (row vs grid vs stacked)
- Catalog request CTA style and placement on Produtos page
- Empresa page content structure and values presentation
- Localização page map embed size and layout
- Contato page contact info grouping and presentation
- All content text for pages (company description, product descriptions, etc.)

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Hero image and product images should be sourced from the current metamedical.com.br site
- Products are: Bleed STP, Pinça Bipolar, and Bleed STP+
- Product descriptions should be brief (1-2 sentences each), not technical spec sheets
