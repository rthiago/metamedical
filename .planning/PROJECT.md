# MetaMedical Website Redesign

## What This Is

A modern redesign of the MetaMedical.com.br institutional website. Same content and information as the current site — company info, products (Bleed STP, Pinça Bipolar, Bleed STP+), location, and contact details — presented with a professional, contemporary medical/corporate layout. Built with plain HTML and CSS, hosted on simple web hosting.

## Core Value

Visitors immediately understand what MetaMedical does and can find product information and contact details with zero friction.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Modern corporate medical design (clean, trustworthy, professional)
- [ ] Same page structure: Home, Empresa, Produtos, Localização, Contato
- [ ] Same product information: Bleed STP, Pinça Bipolar, Bleed STP+
- [ ] Company values and institutional content preserved
- [ ] Contact page with phone, email, address (no form)
- [ ] Mobile-responsive layout
- [ ] Portuguese-only content
- [ ] Plain HTML/CSS — no frameworks, no build tools
- [ ] Deployable to any standard web host

### Out of Scope

- E-commerce / shopping cart — informational site only
- Contact form — info display only, no backend needed
- English translation — Portuguese only
- Customer login / catalog request system — not needed
- CMS / admin panel — static files only
- WhatsApp integration — keeping it simple

## Context

- Current site at metamedical.com.br is functional but dated in design
- Company is based in Osasco, SP, Brazil (CNPJ registered)
- Products are medical devices/supplies — professional, clinical positioning
- Current site has a hamburger menu for mobile, webmail link, footer with registration details
- Site was built by Cedesign — this is a full replacement
- Target audience: healthcare professionals and institutions looking for medical supplies

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Plain HTML and CSS only — no JavaScript frameworks, no build step
- **Content**: Preserve existing information — this is a design refresh, not a content rewrite
- **Language**: Brazilian Portuguese only
- **Hosting**: Must work on simple shared hosting (static file upload)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Plain HTML/CSS over frameworks | Simplicity, easy hosting, no build tools needed | — Pending |
| Info-only contact page | No backend complexity, matches current needs | — Pending |
| Portuguese only | Current audience is Brazilian, no international need | — Pending |
