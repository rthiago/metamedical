## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.1 setup]: Vanilla JS allowed for scroll animations (IntersectionObserver)
- [v1.1 setup]: No animation libraries -- native APIs only
- [v1.1 setup]: CSS scroll-driven animations rejected (Firefox lacks support)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Overlay opacity needs testing with actual product images from metamedical.com.br
- [Research]: Verify Montserrat 800 weight renders well on low-DPI screens
