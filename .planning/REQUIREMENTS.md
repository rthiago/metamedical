# Requirements: MetaMedical Website

**Defined:** 2026-02-19
**Core Value:** Visitors immediately understand what MetaMedical does and can find product information and contact details with zero friction.

## v1.2 Requirements

Requirements for GitHub Pages deployment. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Deployment

- [ ] **DEPLOY-01**: Site source code is hosted in a private GitHub repository named "metamedical"
- [ ] **DEPLOY-02**: Repository contains full git commit history
- [ ] **DEPLOY-03**: GitHub Actions workflow automatically deploys site on push to main
- [ ] **DEPLOY-04**: Site is live and accessible via GitHub Pages URL

## Future Requirements

### Custom Domain

- **DOMAIN-01**: Site is accessible via metamedical.com.br custom domain
- **DOMAIN-02**: HTTPS is configured for custom domain

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Custom domain setup | Deferred to future milestone |
| Branch protection rules | Not needed for single-developer project |
| PR-based workflow | Solo project, direct push to main is fine |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| DEPLOY-01 | Phase 7 | Pending |
| DEPLOY-02 | Phase 7 | Pending |
| DEPLOY-03 | Phase 8 | Pending |
